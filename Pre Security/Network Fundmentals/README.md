## What is Networking?

- Simply things connected

- A Network can be formed by anywhere from 2 devices to billions

- An Essential concept to grasp in cybersecurity.

## What is the Internet?

- The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself
- the Internet is made up of many small networks all joined together.
- Small networks are called `private networks`
- Networks connecting these small networks are called `public networks` or the Internet

Network can be one of two types:

- A private network
- A public network

### Whatâ€™s difference between The Internet and The Web?

|                                          | The Internet               | The Web                                                                               |

| At a high level, we can even think of as | hardware                   | software                                                                              |

    The first iteration of the Internet was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s. This project was funded by the United States Defence Department and was the first documented network in action. However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as we know it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW).

## Identifying Devices on a Network

1.Broadcasting
in computer network is a group communication, where a sender sends data to receivers simultaneously.

2.Vlan
the computers, servers, and other network devices are logically connected regardless of their physical location.

-Traffic Management
-make a network simpler
-improved security

What's important to understand here is that IP addresses can change from device to device but cannot be active simultaneously more than once within the same network.
protocols
are the backbone of networking
force many devices to communicate in the same language

MAC
Media Access Control

IP
Internet Protocol

ping The Most Fundmental Network tools ping use ICMP packets to Determine performance of a connection betwen devices if connection exist or reliable

ICMP
Internet Control Message Protocol

ICMP's => echo packet
=> echo replay
